# ðŸŒ² Testforestfires-ML-Project ðŸ”¥

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that predicts the likelihood of forest fires based on input environmental conditions. The model was trained using real-world forest fire datasets and deployed as a fully functional app.

## ðŸš€ Deployed App

You can try the live demo of the application here:

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Forest fires are a serious environmental concern. This ML project aims to predict the possibility of a forest fire using various meteorological parameters, helping in early warning systems and disaster management.
