# Testforestfires-ML-project

## Project Overview
This project applies machine learning techniques to predict and analyze forest fire occurrences and severity using environmental and meteorological data. The goal is to model fire risk and support forest management or emergency response efforts.

Key Features:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Machine learning model development and evaluation
- Insights for fire risk prediction

Technologies: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

## Dataset
- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository – Forest Fires Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/forest+fires)
- Features: temperature, humidity, wind, rain, and more
- Target: area of forest burned (or categorical fire occurrence)
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing data, normalization, encoding categorical variables

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/bhattacharyaprafullit/Testforestfires-ML-project.git
cd Testforestfires-ML-project

# (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook(s) in the `notebooks/` directory.
- Run cells sequentially to preprocess data, train models, and view results.
- To use your own data, place it in the `data/` directory and update the notebook paths as needed.

## Model Details
- Machine learning approach: regression (predicting burned area) and/or classification (predicting fire occurrence)
- Algorithms: (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Feature selection and engineering steps
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, accuracy, or F1-score as appropriate

## Results
- Summary of model performance (e.g., accuracy, error rates)
- Visualization of important features and predictions
- Main insights and possible applications
